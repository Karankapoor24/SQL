SOLUTION 1

SOLUTION 2

SELECT * FROM (

FROM bms) A
WHERE prev_2=3 OR prev_current_next=3 OR next_2=3
;


SOLUTION 3

WITH diff_num AS (
SELECT 
	*,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY seat_no) AS rn,

), cnt AS (

	diff,
	COUNT(1) AS c

HAVING COUNT(1) > 2
)
SELECT *  
FROM diff_num 
WHERE diff IN (SELECT diff FROM cnt)
