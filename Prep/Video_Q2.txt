A ski resort company is planning to construct a new ski slope using a pre-existing network of mountain huts and trails between them. 
A new slope has to begin at one of the mountain huts, have a middle station at another hut connected with the first one by a direct trail, 
and end at the third mountain hut which is also connected by a direct trail to the second hut. 
The altitude of the three huts chosen for constructing the ski slope has to be strictly decreasing.
You are given two SQL tables, mountain_huts and trails, with the following structure


drop table if exists mountain_huts;
create table mountain_huts 
(
	id 			integer not null unique,
	name 		varchar(40) not null unique,
	altitude 	integer not null
);
insert into mountain_huts values (1, 'Dakonat', 1900);
insert into mountain_huts values (2, 'Natisa', 2100);
insert into mountain_huts values (3, 'Gajantut', 1600);
insert into mountain_huts values (4, 'Rifat', 782);
insert into mountain_huts values (5, 'Tupur', 1370);

drop table if exists trails;
create table trails 
(
	hut1 		integer not null,
	hut2 		integer not null
);
insert into trails values (1, 3);
insert into trails values (3, 2);
insert into trails values (3, 5);
insert into trails values (4, 5);
insert into trails values (1, 5);

select * from mountain_huts;
select * from trails;


Input

mountain_huts

id	name		altitude
1	Dakonat		1900
2	Natisa		2100
3	Gajantut	1600
4	Rifat		782
5	Tupur		1370

trails

hut1	hut2
1		3
3		2
3		5
4		5
1		5


Output

startpt		middlept	endpt
Dakonat		Gajantut	Tupur
Dakonat		Tupur		Rifat
Natisa		Gajantut	Tupur
Gajantut	Tupur		Rifat


Solution


WITH cte AS (
SELECT hut1, hut2 FROM trails
UNION 
SELECT hut2, hut1 FROM trails
)
SELECT 
	mh1.name AS startpt, mh2.name AS middlept, mh3.name AS endpt
FROM cte t1
INNER JOIN cte t2 
ON t1.hut2=t2.hut1 AND t1.hut1 != t2.hut2
INNER JOIN mountain_huts mh1 
ON t1.hut1 = mh1.id
INNER JOIN mountain_huts mh2 
ON t1.hut2 = mh2.id 
INNER JOIN mountain_huts mh3
ON t2.hut2 = mh3.id 
WHERE mh1.altitude > mh2.altitude and mh2.altitude > mh3.altitude
