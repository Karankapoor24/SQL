create table mode 
(
id int
);

insert into mode values (1),(2),(2),(3),(3),(3),(3),(4),(5);

Solution 1

WITH freq_cte AS (
SELECT
	id,
	COUNT(id) AS freq
FROM mode
GROUP BY id
)
SELECT
	id
FROM freq_cte
WHERE freq = (SELECT MAX(freq) FROM freq_cte)

Solution 2

WITH freq_cte AS (
SELECT
	id,
	COUNT(id) AS freq
FROM mode
GROUP BY id
), rnk_cte AS (
SELECT
	*,
	RANK() OVER(ORDER BY freq DESC) AS rn
FROM freq_cte
)
SELECT id FROM rnk_cte
WHERE rn=1
