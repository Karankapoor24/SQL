You are given a table having the marks of one student in every test. 
You have to output the tests in which the student has improved his performance. 
For a student to improve his performance he has to score more than the previous test.
Provide 2 solutions, one including the first test score and second excluding it.


drop table if exists  student_tests;
create table student_tests
(
	test_id		int,
	marks		int
);
insert into student_tests values(100, 55);
insert into student_tests values(101, 55);
insert into student_tests values(102, 60);
insert into student_tests values(103, 58);
insert into student_tests values(104, 40);
insert into student_tests values(105, 50);

select * from student_tests;


Input

test_id	marks
100		55
101		55
102		60
103		58
104		40
105		50


Output 1

test_id	marks
100		55
102		60
105		50


Solution 1

SELECT 
	test_id, marks
FROM (
SELECT 
	*,
	LAG(marks, 1, 0) OVER(ORDER BY test_id) AS prev_test_marks
FROM student_tests
) x
WHERE x.marks > x.prev_test_marks


Output 2

test_id	marks
102		60
105		50


Solution 2

SELECT 
	test_id, marks
FROM (
SELECT 
	*,
	LAG(marks, 1, marks) OVER(ORDER BY test_id) AS prev_test_marks
FROM student_tests
) x
WHERE x.marks > x.prev_test_marks
